# What is this?

### This program will check if the designated folder has a new/updated file in its directory. It will then store this information and send an email of the completed files to the helpdesk email.

# Why is this needed?

### This program should shorten the amount of time needed to verify sales have imported and stores have closed.

# Planned implementation/Research

### I am creating a testing enviroment and once everythine test successfully will work with management to test on a customer. I am aware certain boards have a later polling time so deciding what time to have this program run will be needed as it wont run 24/7. I plan to convert this into an executable application and utilize NSSM to have it run as a service. currently planned email implementation is through a gmail account and app password this will need testing as im not sure if firewall/AV rules would block this on these systems.


# Progress Tracker
### all progress will be noted in commits

## No changes have/will be made without manager approval :)
